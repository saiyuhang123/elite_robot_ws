## Description

This class serves as the configuration input when constructing the `EliteDriver` class, providing parameters such as the robot's IP address and control script path.

## Parameters

- `robot_ip`
    - Type: `std::string`
    - Description: Robot IP address.

- `script_file_path`
    - Type: `std::string`
    - Description: Template for the robot control script. An executable script will be generated based on this template.

- `local_ip`
    - Type: `std::string`
    - Description: Local IP address. When left as default (empty string), `EliteDriver` will attempt to automatically detect the local IP.
    - Note: If the robot cannot connect to your local TCP server via the `socket_open()` script command, you need to manually set this parameter or check your network.

- `headless_mode`:
    - Type: `bool`
    - Description: Whether to run in headless mode。 After using this mode, there is no need to use the 'External Control' plugin. If true, the constructor will send a control script to the robot's primary port once.

- `script_sender_port`
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: Port used for sending control scripts. If this port cannot be connected, the `External Control` plugin will stop immediately.

- `reverse_port`
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: Reverse communication port. This port primarily sends control modes and partial control data.

- `trajectory_port`
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: Port for sending trajectory points.

- `script_command_port`
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: Port for sending script commands.

- `servoj_time`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Time interval for `servoj()` command.

- `servoj_lookahead_time`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Lookahead time for `servoj()` command, range [0.03, 0.2] seconds.

- `servoj_gain`
    - Type: `int`
    - Description: Servo gain.

- `stopj_acc`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Acceleration for stopping motion (rad/s²).

- `servoj_extrapolate_max_time`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Maximum duration [S] for constant-velocity extrapolation when no new `servoj()` point arrives.

- `servoj_decelerate_time`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Deceleration duration [S] used to linearly ramp extrapolation speed down to zero.

- `servoj_hold_velocity_threshold`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Joint velocity threshold [rad/s] used to determine when joints are stable enough to lock a hold position.

- `servoj_hold_stable_time`
    - Type: `float`
    - Description: Stable duration [S] required before locking the hold position after extrapolation speed has converged to zero.

## Tuning Profiles (Network Jitter)

Note: These profiles are tuning guidance based on network quality, not mandatory defaults. Time parameters are in seconds, and velocity threshold is in rad/s.

| Profile | Typical scenario | `servoj_extrapolate_max_time` | `servoj_decelerate_time` | `servoj_hold_velocity_threshold` | `servoj_hold_stable_time` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | Noticeable jitter or occasional packet loss, prioritize anti-runaway behavior | 0.04 | 0.03 | 0.03 | 0.05 |
| Balanced | Typical industrial network, balance tracking and stability | 0.08 | 0.02 | 0.05 | 0.04 |
| Aggressive | Stable network, prioritize tracking feel | 0.12 | 0.01 | 0.08 | 0.03 |

Example:

```cpp
EliteDriverConfig config;

// Balanced profile
config.servoj_extrapolate_max_time = 0.08;
config.servoj_decelerate_time = 0.02;
config.servoj_hold_velocity_threshold = 0.05;
config.servoj_hold_stable_time = 0.04;
```

How to choose a profile:

- Move to a more conservative profile: obvious overshoot, unstable settling, or residual motion after prolonged missing points.
- Move to a more aggressive profile: network is stable and tracking lag is noticeable; better responsiveness is preferred.
- Keep current profile: no runaway risk, no obvious jitter, and tracking error is acceptable.

Quick troubleshooting map:

| Symptom | Tune first | Suggested direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A small "surge" after prolonged missing points | `servoj_decelerate_time` | Increase (smoother convergence) |
| Stops quickly but braking feels too hard | `servoj_decelerate_time` | Increase moderately |
| Noticeable lag / sticky tracking | `servoj_extrapolate_max_time` | Increase (longer constant-velocity window) |
| Jitter before settling; hold lock comes too late | `servoj_hold_velocity_threshold` | Increase moderately |
| Hold locks too early and suppresses fine tracking | `servoj_hold_stable_time` | Increase |
| Hold lock takes too long; drifting feeling persists | `servoj_hold_stable_time` | Decrease |

Suggested safety bounds:

| Parameter | Recommended range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `servoj_extrapolate_max_time` | 0.02 ~ 0.20 | Too small can make tracking feel sticky; too large may amplify extrapolated drift during communication gaps. |
| `servoj_decelerate_time` | 0.005 ~ 0.08 | Too small can feel harsh; too large can delay settling. |
| `servoj_hold_velocity_threshold` | 0.02 ~ 0.12 | Too small may prevent hold lock; too large may lock too early. |
| `servoj_hold_stable_time` | 0.01 ~ 0.10 | Too small can mis-detect stability; too large delays hold lock. |

Note: These are recommended engineering bounds, not hard limits. Adjust one parameter at a time, with 10% to 20% step changes.
